= TweetStream

TweetStream provides simple Ruby access to Twitter's Streaming API
(http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation).

== Installation

The TweetStream gem is available on GitHub and Gemcutter. To get the
latest gem from GitHub:

    gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/
    gem install intridea-tweetstream
    
To install from Gemcutter:

    gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org/
    gem install tweetstream

== Usage

Using TweetStream is quite simple:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'tweetstream'
    
    # This will pull a sample of all tweets based on
    # your Twitter account's Streaming API role.
    TweetStream::Client.new('username','password').sample do |status|
      # The status object is a special Hash with 
      # method access to its keys.
      puts "#{status.text}"
    end
    
You can also use it to track keywords or follow a given set of
user ids:

  # Use 'track' to track a list of single-word keywords
  TweetStream::Client.new('username','password').track('term1', 'term2') do |status|
    puts "#{status.text}"
  end
  
  # Use 'follow' to follow a group of user ids (integers, not screen names)
  TweetStream::Client.new('username','password').follow(14252, 53235) do |status|
    puts "#{status.text}"
  end
  
The methods available to TweetStream::Client will be kept in parity
with the methods available on the Streaming API wiki page.

== Handling Deletes and Rate Limitations

Sometimes the Streaming API will send messages other than statuses.
Specifically, it does so when a status is deleted or rate limitations
have caused some tweets not to appear in the stream. To handle these,
you can use the on_delete and on_limit methods. Example:

    @client = TweetStream::Client.new('user','pass')
    
    @client.on_delete do |status_id, user_id|
      Tweet.delete(status_id)
    end
    
    @client.on_limit do |skip_count|
      # do something
    end  
    
    @client.track('intridea')
    
The on_delete and on_limit methods can also be chained, like so:

    TweetStream::Client.new('user','pass').on_delete{ |status_id, user_id|
      Tweet.delete(status_id)
    }.on_limit { |skip_count|
      # do something
    }.track('intridea') do |status|
      # do something with the status like normal
    end
    
You can also provide <tt>:delete</tt> and/or <tt>:limit</tt> 
options when you make your method call:

    TweetStream::Client.new('user','pass').track('intridea',
      :delete => Proc.new{ |status_id, user_id| # do something },
      :limit => Proc.new{ |skip_count| # do something }
    ) do |status|
      # do something with the status like normal
    end
    
Twitter recommends honoring deletions as quickly as possible, and
you would likely be wise to integrate this functionality into your
application.

== Terminating a TweetStream

It is often the case that you will need to change the parameters of your
track or follow tweet streams. In the case that you need to terminate
a stream, simply call <tt>TweetStream::Client.stop</tt> from within your
loop:

    # Stop after collecting 10 statuses
    @statuses = []
    TweetStream::Client.new('username','password').track('term1', 'term2') do |status|
      @statuses << status
      TweetStream::Client.stop if @statuses.size >= 10
    end
    
When <tt>stop</tt> is called, TweetStream will return from the block
the last successfully yielded status, allowing you to make note of
it in your application as necessary.

== Daemonizing

It is also possible to create a daemonized script quite easily
using the TweetStream library:

  # The third argument is an optional process name
  TweetStream::Client.new('username','password').track('term1', 'term2') do |status|
    # do something in the background
  end
  
If you put the above into a script and run the script with <tt>ruby scriptname.rb</tt>, you will see a list of daemonization commands such
as start, stop, and run.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
